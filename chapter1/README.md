Work in development
===================
To see the progress with the [`model`](https://github.com/willvieira/PhD/blob/master/chapter1/vissault_model.R), analysis and everything else, you can take a look in the rendered [script.pdf](https://github.com/willvieira/PhD/blob/master/chapter1/script.pdf).

TODO
====

-   [X] In `Test2` add different lines for each fixed value: 0.2, 0.5, 0.8
-   [ ] Solve differential equation to equilibrium
-   [ ] Use `expand.grid` to test all possible variation between parameters
